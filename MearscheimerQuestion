So, I understand that you are a theorist, but I'd really like to ask about how you understand the practical details of the situation you are talking about.  In 3/4 of the cases you mention as examples of rising regional hegemons that the US intevered to thwart, these were states that were invading their neighbors and didn't have nuclear weapons.
